            <p class="TopMargin BiggerFont">This website was made as an assignment in a class at IT-h√∂gskolan about Vue.
                The data is
                fetched from the website <strong>API Ninjas</strong> from the following adress: <a
                    href="https://api-ninjas.com/api/covid19">https://api-ninjas.com/api/covid19</a>. The data was then
                crossreferenced with data from the following websites:</p>
            <p class="TopMargin">
            <h4 class="BiggerFont">Our World in Data</h4><a class=" TopMargin"

            </p>
            <p class="TopMargin BiggerFont"> The mentioned websites had wide differences in their statistics.
                <strong>Our World in
                    Data</strong> had the maximum level of cases in China at about 5 million; In Sweden the maximum
                level of
                cases was 40 000. According to <strong>Wikipedia</strong> the maximum level of cases in Sweden was about
                2.7
                million. The data from <strong>API Ninjas</strong> matches the data from the first source about China (5
                million cases), but the second source about Sweden (2.7 million cases). It is also unclear from where
                the
                data at <strong>API Ninjas</strong> was sourced. </p>
            <p class="TopMargin BiggerFont">Conclusion is to take the statistics on this website with a grain of salt.
